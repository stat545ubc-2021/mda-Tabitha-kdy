This repository contains Tabitha Kennedy's work for STAT 545A Assignment: Mini Data Analysis. 

**Milestone 1 Summary:**

The file Kennedy_Tabitha_1.Rmd is the first in a series of deliverables for STAT 545A's Mini Data Analysis Assignment. The goal for the first deliverable in the Mini Data Analysis Assignment is for students to become familiar with data analysis techniques using the R programming language. Students select a dataset of their choosing (for my project, I have selected the apt_buildings dataset available through the datateachr package) and formalize research questions related to their dataset that they wish to explore in future sections of the assignment. Students also gain practice in generating tidy and reproducible code through the use of R Markdown. In the section below, I explore the apt_buildings dataset provided courtesy of The City of Torontoâ€™s Open Data Portal using data analysis techniques taught within STAT 545A. 

**Milestone 2 Summary:**

The file Kennedy_Tabitha_2.Rmd is the second in a series of deliverables for STAT 545A's Mini Data Analysis Assignment. The goal of the second deliverable is for students to achieve the following (as seen on STAT545 A website):
1. Become familiar with manipulating and summarizing your data in tibbles using dplyr and tidyr, with a research question in mind.
2. Understand what tidy data is, and how to create it. In milestone 3, we will explore when this might be useful.
3. Generate a reproducible and clear report using R Markdown.
4. Gain a greater understanding of how to use R to answer research questions about your data.
