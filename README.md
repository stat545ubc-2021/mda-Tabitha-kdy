This repository contains Tabitha Kennedy's work for STAT 545A Assignment: Mini Data Analysis. 

**Milestone 1 Summary:**

The files Kennedy_Tabitha_1.Rmd and Kennedy_Tabitha_1.md are the first in a series of deliverables for STAT 545A's Mini Data Analysis Assignment. The goal for the first deliverable in the Mini Data Analysis Assignment is for students to become familiar with data analysis techniques using the R programming language. Students select a dataset of their choosing (for my project, I have selected the apt_buildings dataset available through the datateachr package) and formalize research questions related to their dataset that they wish to explore in future sections of the assignment. Students also gain practice in generating tidy and reproducible code through the use of R Markdown. In the section below, I explore the apt_buildings dataset provided courtesy of The City of Torontoâ€™s Open Data Portal using data analysis techniques taught within STAT 545A. 

**Milestone 2 Summary:**

The files Kennedy_Tabitha_2.Rmd and Kennedy_Tabitha_2.md are the second in a series of deliverables for STAT 545A's Mini Data Analysis Assignment. The goal of the second deliverable is for students to achieve the following (as seen on STAT 545A website):
1. Become familiar with manipulating and summarizing your data in tibbles using dplyr and tidyr, with a research question in mind.
2. Understand what tidy data is, and how to create it. In milestone 3, we will explore when this might be useful.
3. Generate a reproducible and clear report using R Markdown.
4. Gain a greater understanding of how to use R to answer research questions about your data.

**Milestone 3 Summary:**

The files Kennedy_Tabitha_3.Rmd, Kennedy_Tabitha_3.md, and the folder *output* are the third and final in a series of deliverables for STAT 545A's Mini Data Analysis Assignment. Building off the work from Milestone 2, the goal of the third deliverable is for students to become familiar with the following concepts (as seen on STAT 545A website):
1. Manipulating special data types in R: factors and/or dates and times.
2. Fitting a model object to your data, and extract a result.
3. Reading and writing data as separate files.
